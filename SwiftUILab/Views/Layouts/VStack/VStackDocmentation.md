//The VStack allows you to stack views vertically, from top to bottom. You can further customize the view by adding alignment or spacing to the VStack.


## 1. Vstack by default have no width and height.

## 2. If we set manual width and height VStack align perameter wil not work

## 3. For full screen width and height alway set frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
